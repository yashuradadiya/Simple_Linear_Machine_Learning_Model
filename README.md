# *Linear Regression Model Implementation*

## Overview:
This repository contains code for implementing a simple linear machine learning model using Python and the scikit-learn library. The model is designed for regression tasks and is implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Additionally, there is a separate Python script for deploying the trained model using Streamlit.

## Contents:
- **Notebooks (.ipynb):**
  - These Jupyter Notebooks guide through the implementation of the linear regression model.
  - Sections include data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
  - Code cells are organized sequentially to facilitate step-by-step implementation.

- **Dataset Files (.csv):**
  - The CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
  - It includes both predictor variables and the target variable.

- **Deployment Script (.py):**
  - A Python script (`app.py`) for deploying the trained model using Streamlit.
  - The script loads the trained model from a pickle file and provides a user interface for making predictions.

- **Model Files (.pkl):**
  - `model.pkl`: This pickle file contains the trained linear regression model.
  - `scaler.pkl`: This pickle file contains the scaler object used for preprocessing the data before model training.

## Dependencies:
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your Python environment:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- pickle

## Usage:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have all dependencies installed in your Python environment.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory containing the repository.
4. Open any `.ipynb` notebook to access the model implementation.
5. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook and run each code cell sequentially.
6. The notebook will guide you through loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training the linear regression model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions.
7. Modify the code cells as needed to experiment with different datasets, model parameters, or evaluation metrics.

## Deployment:
1. To deploy the trained model, navigate to the directory containing the repository.
2. Ensure `model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` files are present in the directory.
3. Run the deployment script using the following command:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. This will start a local server hosting the Streamlit app.
5. Access the app through your web browser and interact with the deployed model.

## Note:
Ensure that you have the trained model (`model.pkl`) and scaler object (`scaler.pkl`) saved in the same directory as `app.py` for successful deployment.
