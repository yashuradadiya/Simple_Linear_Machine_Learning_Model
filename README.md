# Simple Linear Machine Learning Model

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a simple implementation of a linear machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn library.

## Contents
-  all  `.ipynb`: These Jupyter Notebooks contain the implementation of the linear regression model. It includes sections for data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and prediction. All code cells are organized sequentially to guide through the implementation step by step.
- all `.csv`: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. It includes both the predictor variables and the target variable.
## Dependencies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage
1. Make sure you have all the dependencies installed in your Python environment.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory containing the repository.
4. Open the any `.ipynb` notebook.
5. Follow the instructions and run each code cell sequentially.
6. The notebook will guide you through loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training the linear regression model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions.
7. You can modify the code cells as needed to experiment with different datasets, model parameters, or evaluation metrics.
